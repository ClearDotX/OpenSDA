    TWR-KV11Z75M
    FRDM-KV11Z
    TWR-KV46F150
    HVP-KV46F256
    

MSD - DEBUG version 1.18

  - added MSD support for both P and D FLASH memory for EVB-S32K144 board.

TWR-K80F150M and FRDM-K82F support for internal 256k and QSPI Aliased FLASH starting at location 0x4000000

  - MSD-DEBUG-TWR-K80F150M_Pemicro_v117.SDA - DEBUG, Mass Storage Device support for internal FLASH memory
  - MSD-DEBUG-TWR-K80F150M-QSPI_Pemicro_v117.SDA - DEBUG, Mass Storage Device support for Aliased QSPI parallel
    configuration starting at 0x4000000
  - MSD-DEBUG-FRDM-K82F_Pemicro_v117.SDA - DEBUG, Mass Storage Device support for internal FLASH memory
  - MSD-DEBUG-FRDM-K82F-QSPI_Pemicro_v117.SDA - DEBUG, Mass Storage Device support for Aliased QSPI parallel
    configuration starting at 0x4000000

DEBUG version 1.08 for MBED:
  - Adds universal OpenSDA Debug firmware that is capable of running on top of OpenSDA board programmed with 
    MBED Bootloader

DEBUG_OpenSDA_for_MBED_Bootloader_by_Pemicro_v108.bin

MSD - DEBUG version 1.17
  - Includes sectore erase support, instead of mass erase for TWR-KV31F120M and X-HPV-KV31F120M boards to 
    prevent loss of information in execute only parts of FLASH memory

MSD - DEBUG version 1.15
  - Includes a soft reset fix for FRDM-K20D50M board, which would lead to MSD 
    FLASH programming issue.

MSD - DEBUG version 1.14

  - Added combined MSD, DEBUG and CDC virtual serial support in a single APP.
    Switching between MSD and DEBUG apps is no longer necessary

  - Added Windows 8.1 support. 

MSD version 1.12 

  - added Linux and MAC support

MSD Version 1.09 and DEBUG Version 1.06

  - Fixed virtual serial 8 bits with parity and 7 bits with parity cases.
  - Chanded RESET_B configuration to minimize current draw

MSD Version 1.08

  - Added a pullup to the RXD line of vertual serial port

MSD Version 1.07

  - Improved initial communications to the target MCU to address cases where
    the reset line is disabled or the low power boot mode is used. This may
    previously have resulted in inability to reprogram the target MCU. 

MSD Version 1.06

  - Support added for Linux Operating System (Tested on Ubuntu)

MSD Version 1.05
  - Reset and Run after programming was fixed for secure devices
  - If an illegal file was dropped to it, the LEDs wouldn't blink an error, device would stop working.
  - Protected against programming the FSEC in a way which permanently secures the device
